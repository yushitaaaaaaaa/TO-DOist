# TO-DOist

User-friendly web-based application for managing tasks with priorities and deadlines, featuring seamless CRUD operations and a visually appealing interface.

Technologies Used: 

MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js (MERN stack), MERN Authentication with JWT, Postman for testing APIs

Key Features:

Developed a task management app with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks, prioritization using a numeric scale, and deadline selection via calendar integration. Built a responsive front-end and a robust backend with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, ensuring real-time updates and seamless user experience.

Process:

Planning: Outlined key features, including CRUD operations, search functionality, and sorting tasks (e.g., by deadline, priority, ascending/descending order).

Front-End Development: Designed an intuitive React-based UI for task management, with options for search and sorting directly on the interface.

Back-End Development: Built RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express to handle CRUD operations and implement search and sorting logic.

Database Setup: Structured a MongoDB schema to support filtering and sorting operations efficiently, with fields like task title, description, priority, and deadline.

Feature Integration: Added search functionality for quick retrieval of tasks and sorting options to organize tasks dynamically based on user preferences.

Testing: Ensured each feature (CRUD, search, sorting) worked seamlessly across different scenarios, including large task lists.

Deployment: Deployed the app with optimized performance, enabling users to manage, search, and organize their tasks effortlessly.
